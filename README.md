# Harvard CS50: Introduction to Computer Science
These are my solutions to Harvard University's "CS50 2017: Introduction to Computer Science" course offered at edX. I used both CS50's [c9.io](https://c9.io/) IDE and my own text editor on linux & macOS + [cs50's](http://www.oss.io/p/cs50/library50-c) Libraries to complete this course (library [rederences](https://reference.cs50.net/) here.)

To complete the following Problem Sets, I [studied](https://study.cs50.net/) all of the CS50's [lectures](http://docs.cs50.net/2017/x/syllabus.html#lectures), shorts, [walkthroughs](http://docs.cs50.net/2017/x/syllabus.html#walkthroughs), and participated in class discussions via [/r/CS50](https://www.reddit.com/r/cs50/) on Reddit. All Problem Set submissions received scores of 100% from the https://cs50.me/ gradebook.
> NOTE: This course is still in progress, some psets will be missing. If a pset you're looking for is missing, it means I havn't gotten that far in the course yet.

### About CS50 @ Harvard (sylabus):
This course teaches you how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience. 68% of CS50 students have never taken CS before.
